### 🎨 How MoviesHub Works

#### Initialization

- Waits for the DOM to fully load before executing scripts.

- Initializes the Materialize carousel with customized settings for smooth animation and infinite looping.

- Dynamically creates dot indicators based on the number of movies in the array.

#### Slide & Background Management

- The `changeBg(bg, title)` function updates the banner’s background image using the active movie’s `bg` property.

- Content blocks corresponding to the active movie’s title become visible by toggling the `.active` class, hiding all others.

- Dot indicators update visually to reflect the current active slide.

#### Autoplay & User Controls

- Autoplay cycles slides every 4 seconds using a `setInterval` timer.

- Manual interactions like clicking dots or slides permanently stop autoplay, revealing a **“Resume Autoplay”** button and a **“Paused”** label.

- Hovering over carousel items temporarily pauses autoplay without fully disabling it, improving user control during browsing.

- Clicking the resume button restarts autoplay, clearing the manual pause flag.

#### Touch & Swipe Support

- Swipe gestures (left/right) on mobile devices trigger previous/next slide navigation.

- Swipe detection thresholds prevent accidental slide changes.

#### Visual & UX Enhancements

- Dot indicators provide clear visual feedback on current slide.

- Paused state is communicated through a translucent label.

- Resume button is styled to be accessible but unobtrusive.

- Smooth fade and slide animations provide a polished user experience.

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Adding Your Own Movies

**Update Movie Array**

In `main.js`, replace or add movie objects with your own images and titles:

```js
const movies = [
  { bg: "your-bg-image.jpg", title: "your-movie-title" },
  // Add more movies as needed
];
```

**Add Images**  
Place your background images inside the `images/movies/` folder, ensuring filenames exactly match the `bg` property in your movie objects.

**Modify Content Blocks**  
Update or add corresponding `.content` blocks in `index.html` with classes matching your movie titles to show custom info.

**Style as Needed**  
Tweak `styles.css` for fonts, colors, layout, or animations to match your branding.
